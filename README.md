The **"Secure Energy Harvesting System -from-footstep-and-thermal-gardientssystem"** project focuses on generating renewable energy by combining piezoelectric sensors and thermoelectric generators (TEGs). Footsteps and ambient heat are used to produce electricity, which is then stored in rechargeable batteries. The system employs RFID authentication to securely allow users to access the stored energy for mobile charging. IoT-based monitoring is implemented to optimize performance. The project aims to provide a sustainable, eco-friendly solution for powering devices in public spaces while ensuring energy access is secure. Simulations show effective energy generation, making it viable for smart cities and environmentally conscious infrastructure.
